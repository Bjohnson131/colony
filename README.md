# COLONY

COLONY is a Rust game, built with Bevy, that plays like any other colony simulator game. The current version is very basic, there are basic food items that your units can consume, your units have basic stats like hunger, and there is some basic map generation.



## Getting Started

Generally ```cargo build``` and then ```cargo run``` works fine on Windows 11.
